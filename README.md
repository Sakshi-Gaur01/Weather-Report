# ☁️ Weather Insights Dashboard - Power BI
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze global weather trends across countries—focusing on metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions over time.


## 📌 Project Description
The ClimaView Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual analysis of daily weather patterns across multiple cities worldwide. Designed for weather analysts, students, and planners, it helps monitor climate indicators like temperature ranges, weather conditions, and humidity trends to support data-driven decision-making and awareness.


## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Power BI Desktop** – Data visualization and report creation  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and logic  
- **Data Modeling** – Relationships between weather metrics and cities  
- **File Format** – `.pbix` for report, `.png` for visuals/screenshots  


## 🌍 Data Source

- **Source**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) / Kaggle Weather Datasets *(choose based on your project)*  
- **Description**: Daily weather records including:
  - Temperature (Min/Max/Avg)
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Weather Conditions (Clear, Rainy, Snowy, etc.)
  - City and Country Info
  - Timestamps (Date)

## 📈 Features & Highlights

### 💼 Business Problem  
Stakeholders like tourists, researchers, and governments need a simple, visual way to understand and compare weather conditions across regions — but raw weather data is often too complex to interpret.

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard  
To offer an intuitive, filterable, and interactive visual report that:
- Provides weather insights across multiple cities
- Supports planning, research, and awareness
- Highlights patterns in temperature, climate, and wind behavior

### 🔍 Key Visuals
- **Global KPIs**: Total cities, average temperature, extreme conditions  
- **City Filter Panel**: Select any city to drill down  
- **Temperature Trends (Line Chart)**: Shows min, max, and average temps  
- **Weather Type Distribution (Donut Chart)**: % of sunny, cloudy, rainy days  
- **Humidity vs Wind Speed (Scatter Plot)**: Spot patterns in extremes  
- **City-wise Heatmap**: Compare temperature variation across regions  

### 💡 Business Impact
- **Climate Monitoring**: Track changes in temperature/humidity trends  
- **Travel Planning**: Choose cities with favorable weather conditions  
- **Event Scheduling**: Identify ideal weather windows for outdoor activities  
- **Policy & Awareness**: Helps officials focus on weather-prone regions
